# Car-Parking-System-using-Arduino

## verify & Compile the code

- For export -> Sketch -> Export Compiled Binary -> so our hex file will be generated

- That hex file we will use in proteus to simulate schematic

- Its done now

### Lets go back to proteus

## For upload code:
1.	Click Arduino and Goto program file menu
2.	Choose hex file from documents -> Arduino - > project name
3.	Select standard hex file
4.	Select ok

## For simulation:
1.	Click run

## Observations:
1.	Lcd display message Gate opening
2.	Motor run clockwise
3.	Lcd will show Parking area status
4.	Close the PIR1 switch
5.	Lcd show parking areah 1 has occupied
6.	And when parking area fully occupied
7.	Motor will run anti-clockwise
